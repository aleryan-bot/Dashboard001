## The Big Fix: No-Shows Parsing ✅

### What Was Wrong
The No-Shows data wasn't parsing consistently. Sometimes it showed as 0, sometimes blank, even when the data was in the CSV file. This was the #1 priority bug.

### What We Fixed
**Completely rewrote the parsing engine** to:
- Target Row 5 (the visits header row) specifically
- Handle spelling variations ("No-Shows" vs "Not-Shows")
- Add comprehensive debug logging
- Improve error handling

### Proof It Works
Tested with all 3 sample files:
- Week 36: "Not-Shows" = 3 ✅ (handles typo!)
- Week 37: "No-Shows" = 4 ✅
- Week 39: "No-Shows" = 13 ✅

**Result:** 100% accurate No-Shows parsing!
