## Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Use Excel Multi-Sheet Files
Instead of uploading 4 separate CSVs, create one Excel file with 4 sheets. One upload = all weeks!

### Tip 2: Hide Instead of Delete
Hide weeks you don't need right now. You can always show them later. Delete is permanent!

### Tip 3: Export Monthly
At the end of each month, export to Excel. Create a library of monthly reports.

### Tip 4: Compare Sequential Weeks
To spot trends, compare Week 36 vs 37, then 37 vs 38, etc.

### Tip 5: Print to PDF
Use "Print Report" and choose "Save as PDF" to create shareable monthly reports.
